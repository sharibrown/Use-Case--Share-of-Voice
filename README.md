When connecting to your source JSON file directory you will need to do a few things.  

1.  Click on the file input module and configure the input data source.  
2.  File browse for all file types (it defaults to all data files).
3.  Click on one of your files to set the path.
4.  Alter the path to maintain your file prefix and then a wildcard.  
5.  Read the file as a built in type "Comma Delimited Text File".
6.  Delimit with \0
7.  Set the field length to 999999
8.  1st row is not field names (leave this box unchecked)
